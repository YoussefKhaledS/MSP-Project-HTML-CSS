1 - Home Page :
	=> HTML :
		+ code is very well structured
		+ code is well commented
		- semantic tags are not used -- 
		- commented code should be removed before pushing the code to github
	=> CSS :
		+ using variables in code 
		+ code is well commented
		+ applying reasonable margin - padding to elements
		-> (in new design section)
		 	+ using grid to move elements
		 	- (in .clothes.block) don't use large fixed height for elements, consider using images with same dimensions to avoid bad code reviews 
		-> (in sale section) 
			+ proper use of transform property
			+ using grid to move elements
			- (about-us-contact-us-container) is not responsive , grid-template-columns should be adjusted in mobile view	
			- (in #about) large elements shouldn't be moved by position absolute, consider using container with lower width instead
			- (in #contact) don't give larage fixed width to elements (as 600px) , don't move large elements with position absolute  
		+ overall design implementation is great
	=> JS : 
		+ Creating a Slider ++

3 - Login & Register Pages :
	=> HTML :
		+ code is very well structured
		+ semantic tags are used properly 
		+ validation is applied on input fields 
	=> CSS :
		+ using selectors other than classes and id
		- not using variables in code 	
 		- giving fixed width,height to elements will cause issues in responsive views
 		- centering the form with position absolute caused it to float out of the body, better to use flex here
 		- giving background image to the whole body is not right, instead use a div with 100vh and giv it background image
 		- code is not commented
	=> JS :
		+ using local storage to store users ++
